## Summary
1.**What was this homework about? Relate it to what we discussed in class.**

*This homework was about how to apply a linear fit algebraiclly and how it is widely overused in many scientific studies for a variety of reasons. We applied the algebraic fit as we were shown in class and added the proper error bars to the fit that were provided by the paper.*

  
2.**What was the hardest part of the homework for you?**

*The hardest part of this homework was trying to distribute work because there was so little to do and we wanted to make sure everyone had a part*
  
3.**What was the easiest part of the homework for you?**

*The easiest part of this homework was ensuring PEP8 compliance. Most of the code was short and simple and did not even pass the 80 character limit per line.*
  
4.**One new thing that you have learned**
  
*I learned that a linear regression fit can be directly solve using matrices and linear algebra.*
